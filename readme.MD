# Analysis on Crime Dataset.
Dataset :  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime

Using the R Programming Lanaguage used "PCA" and Linear Regression with Cross Validation with K=10 to predict  "Violent Crimes per Population".

 Crime Dataset contains 127 attribute, with target attribute ViolentCrimesPerPop.
 This is carried out in following steps:
 * Step 1: Read the dataset.
 * Step 2: Clean the dataset.
 * Step 3: DO PCA
 * Step 4: Apply linear regression with cross validation with k=10 using glm.net
 * Step 5: Calculate MSE 

# Results
 * MSE On Test data : 0.05366028
 * MSE On Train data : 0.05791931

## Also used Weka tool to compare the different methods for analysis as well.
